🕹️ MML Arcade Cabinet

A fully interactive retro arcade cabinet living inside a Metaverse world — built with MML, Node.js, GitHub Pages, and EmulatorJS.


🎮 What Is This?
This project brings a playable SNES arcade cabinet into a 3D Metaverse world powered by MML (Metaverse Markup Language). Players can walk up to the cabinet, press E to interact, and launch a real SNES game — all without leaving the world.
The cabinet is a fully 3D object with:

A glowing ARCADE marquee
A joystick and buttons on the control panel
A game screen showing a preview image
A proximity interaction prompt
A live WebSocket MML document served from Railway

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the MML Server Repo
bashgit clone https://github.com/jdunk4/mml-arcade-server.git
cd mml-arcade-server
npm install
2. Run Locally
bashnpm start
# Server running on ws://localhost:3000
3. Deploy to Railway

Push to GitHub
Go to railway.app → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
Select mml-arcade-server
Railway auto-detects Node.js and runs npm start
Go to Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
Your live WebSocket URL:

wss://mml-arcade-server.railway.app
4. Place in Your MML World
html<m-frame src="wss://mml-arcade-server.railway.app"></m-frame>

🎯 How The Emulator Works
The emulator is hosted separately on GitHub Pages at:
https://jdunk4.github.io/Gamer/game.html
It uses EmulatorJS — a browser-based multi-system emulator — to load and run the SNES ROM directly in the browser with zero installation required.
Adding Your Own ROM

Add your .sfc ROM file to the rom/ folder in the Gamer GitHub repo
Edit game.html and update this line:

javascriptEJS_gameUrl = "./rom/YOUR-ROM-FILENAME.sfc";

Make sure the filename exactly matches (case sensitive!)
Commit and push — GitHub Pages auto-deploys within 1-2 minutes


🛠️ MML Cabinet Reference
The arcade cabinet is built using these MML elements:
ElementPurpose<m-cube>Cabinet body, bezel, marquee, control panel<m-sphere>Joystick ball and buttons<m-label>Glowing ARCADE text<m-image>Game preview screen image<m-interaction>"Press E to Play" proximity prompt<m-link>Launches the game on interact
Customizing the Cabinet
Change the cabinet color:
html<m-cube color="#1a1a2e"> <!-- Change hex color here -->
Change the marquee text:
html<m-label content="YOUR TEXT HERE">
Change interaction range (meters):
html<m-interaction range="2.5"> <!-- Default: 2.5 meters -->
Change the game URL:
html<m-link href="https://your-game-url.com/game.html">

🔧 Troubleshooting
Cabinet doesn't appear in world

Check Railway deployment logs — look for MML server running on port...
Make sure your m-frame src uses wss:// not https://

Game doesn't load

Check ROM filename is exactly correct including capitalization
Verify the file is in the rom/ folder on GitHub
Wait 1-2 minutes after pushing — GitHub Pages has a deploy delay

EmulatorJS stuck loading

Check browser console for errors
Try a hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)
Verify the CDN is reachable: https://cdn.emulatorjs.org/stable/data/loader.js

Wrong base ROM error when patching

Make sure you're using the correct regional version of the game (USA vs EUR vs JPN)
Try a different version of the base ROM


📖 Background — How This Was Built
This project started as a simple question: "Can we play SNES ROM hacks inside a Metaverse world?"
The journey involved:

Converting ROM hack files — learning the difference between .zip, .bps, .sfc, and .gba files and how ROM patching works with Floating IPS
Setting up EmulatorJS — hosting a browser-based SNES emulator on GitHub Pages with the ROM file served alongside it
Understanding MML — discovering that MML is WebSocket-based and that static hosts like Arweave and GitHub Pages can't serve live MML documents
Building the WebSocket server — using @mml-io/networked-dom-server on Railway to serve the arcade cabinet as a proper live MML document
Placing it in the world — using <m-frame> to pull the cabinet into the Unreal-based Metaverse world
